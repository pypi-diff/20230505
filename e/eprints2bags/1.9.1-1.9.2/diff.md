-        _Version 1.9.1_: This release updates the README file to explain how to install from PyPI, and fixes some internal files related to producing releases on PyPI.
-        
-        _Version 1.9.0_: This release fixes a couple of minor bugs.  It also changes the debug flag letter to be `-@` and changes the behavior of the flag; these changes are not backward-compatible.  Internally, it changes the setup process to use `setup.cfg` and uses a new way to get package metadata.  Finally, this version is being made available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/eprints2bags).
+        _Version 1.9.2_: **Critical fix** &ndash; this version fixes a bug that caused `eprints2bags` to write zero-length data files when used with newer versions of Python.  **You should upgrade your copy of `eprints2bags` to this version**.  This version also reports skipped records separately from missing records (in the final summary at the end of a run).
         
         The file [CHANGES](CHANGES.md) contains a more complete change log that includes information about previous releases.

         As an alternative to getting it from PyPI, you can instruct `pip` to install `eprints2bags` directly from the GitHub repository:

         On Linux and macOS systems, assuming that the installation proceeds normally, you should end up with a program called `eprints2bags` in a location normally searched by your terminal shell for commands.

         ### Additional notes and considerations
         
         Beware that some file systems have limitations on the number of subdirectories that can be created, which directly impacts how many record subdirectories can be created by this program.  `eprints2bags` attempts to guess the type of file system where the output is being written and warn the user if the number of records exceeds known maximums (e.g., 31,998 subdirectories for the [ext2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext2) and [ext3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3) file systems in Linux), but its internal table does not include all possible file systems and it may not be able to warn users in all cases.  If you encounter file system limitations on the number of subdirectories that can be created, a simple solution is to manually create an intermediate level of subdirectories under the destination given to `-o`, then run `eprints2bags` multiple times, each time indicating a different subrange of records to the `-i` option and a different subdirectory to `-o`, such that the number of records written to each destination is below the file system's limit on total number of directories.
         
         It is also noteworthy that hitting a server for tens of thousands of records and documents in rapid succession is likely to draw suspicion from server administrators.  By default, this program inserts a small delay between record fetches (adjustable using the `-y` command-line option), which may be too short in some cases.  Setting the value to 0 is also possible, but might get you blocked or banned from an institution's servers.

 üèÅ Log of recent changes
 -----------------------
 
-_Version 1.9.1_: This release updates the README file to explain how to install from PyPI, and fixes some internal files related to producing releases on PyPI.
-
-_Version 1.9.0_: This release fixes a couple of minor bugs.  It also changes the debug flag letter to be `-@` and changes the behavior of the flag; these changes are not backward-compatible.  Internally, it changes the setup process to use `setup.cfg` and uses a new way to get package metadata.  Finally, this version is being made available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/eprints2bags).
+_Version 1.9.2_: **Critical fix** &ndash; this version fixes a bug that caused `eprints2bags` to write zero-length data files when used with newer versions of Python.  **You should upgrade your copy of `eprints2bags` to this version**.  This version also reports skipped records separately from missing records (in the final summary at the end of a run).
 
 The file [CHANGES](CHANGES.md) contains a more complete change log that includes information about previous releases.

 Then, to install `eprints2bags` from the Python package repository, run the following command:

 As an alternative to getting it from PyPI, you can instruct `pip` to install `eprints2bags` directly from the GitHub repository:
 ```sh
-python3 -m pip install git+https@github.com:caltechlibrary/eprints2bags.git --user --upgrade

 On Linux and macOS systems, assuming that the installation proceeds normally, you should end up with a program called `eprints2bags` in a location normally searched by your terminal shell for commands.

 ### Additional notes and considerations
 
 Beware that some file systems have limitations on the number of subdirectories that can be created, which directly impacts how many record subdirectories can be created by this program.  `eprints2bags` attempts to guess the type of file system where the output is being written and warn the user if the number of records exceeds known maximums (e.g., 31,998 subdirectories for the [ext2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext2) and [ext3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3) file systems in Linux), but its internal table does not include all possible file systems and it may not be able to warn users in all cases.  If you encounter file system limitations on the number of subdirectories that can be created, a simple solution is to manually create an intermediate level of subdirectories under the destination given to `-o`, then run `eprints2bags` multiple times, each time indicating a different subrange of records to the `-i` option and a different subdirectory to `-o`, such that the number of records written to each destination is below the file system's limit on total number of directories.
 
 It is also noteworthy that hitting a server for tens of thousands of records and documents in rapid succession is likely to draw suspicion from server administrators.  By default, this program inserts a small delay between record fetches (adjustable using the `-y` command-line option), which may be too short in some cases.  Setting the value to 0 is also possible, but might get you blocked or banned from an institution's servers.
